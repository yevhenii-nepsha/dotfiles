# External Knowledge & Research

IMPORTANT: Verify information about libraries, APIs, and third-party code when uncertain.

## When Knowledge Might Be Outdated

- Library versions, API endpoints, or syntax have changed
- Using newer libraries or frameworks (released after training cutoff)
- User mentions specific version numbers that seem recent
- Documentation or best practices might have evolved

## Actions to Take

- Use WebFetch tool to verify current standards and best practices
- Check official documentation for latest API signatures
- Search for recent examples and common patterns
- Confirm breaking changes or deprecations

## DO NOT

- Assume your training data reflects current state
- Provide outdated code patterns without verification
- Skip research when uncertain about version compatibility
